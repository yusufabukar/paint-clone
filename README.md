# Paint Clone
* Transport yourself back to the 90s and 00s, unleash your inner Picasso, and create a masterpiece (at least according to your Mum)!
* Save your canvas locally and load it later when you are ready to finish it, or clear it altogether if you need to start again.
* Download your painting once you are done; perhaps you could sell it for millions...*
* \* There is no guarantee that your creation will sell for anything.
